 nodesenda is a simple Node.js project that uses Nodemailer to send test emails programmatically.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your system. You can download them from the official website: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org).

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/clasikpaige/nodesenda
cd nodesenda
```

2. Install the project dependencies
 using npm:

3.Open the sendmail.js file in the project directory and replace the following placeholders with your email credentials:

  auth: {
    user: 'your_email@gmail.com',
    pass: 'your_email_password',
  },
});

const mailOptions = {
  from: 'your_email@gmail.com',
  to: 'recipient@example.com',
};
```
Usage

To send a test email, simply execute the sendmail.js script using Node.js:

node sendmail.js

The script will automatically send the email to the specified recipient using the provided email service.

Customize the Email Content

To customize the content of the test email, you can modify the text field in the mailOptions object within the sendmail.js file. Update the message text to include the content you want to send in the email.



Replace the placeholders (e.g., `your-username`, `your_email@gmail.com`, `your_email_password`, `recipient@example.com`) with the appropriate values relevant to your project. the `README.md` file provides an overview of the project, installation instructions, usage details.
